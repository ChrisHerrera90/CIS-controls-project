# CIS Controls Version 8.1 Implementation Project for a SaaS Based Online Business
This is a project walkthrough of a complete CIS Controls implementation that I designed for a real small-sized business (business name redacted for privacy) built on the GoHighLevel Platform (Elite360). 

In this project, I performed an audit of an online coaching business utilizing the CIS Controls Version 8.1 framework. Once I completed the audit, I then provided steps for remediation in order tp make this business compliant based on these controls.

**Note:** Due to the fact that this business built all of their digital assets on a SaaS platform, not all CIS controls will be applicable for this project since I do not have access to the GoHighLevel/Elite360 IT infrastructure. Therefore, the CIS Controls Framework has been adapted for SaaS usage instead of infrastructure hardening. 

## üîí Security Disclosure
This project contains anonymized configurations and data for demonstration purposes only. No real customer, business, or platform credentials are included in this repository.

### üìã CIS Control 1: Inventory and Control of Assets

This control is about maintaining an up-to-date inventory of all the business' GoHighLevel sub-accounts, domains, websites, and client-facing assets to reduce shadow IT and manage attack surface exposure. These are the steps I took to implement this control:

In order to identify all critical assets for inventory, I went through the following areas of the business GoHighLevel dashboard:
- Contacts (email list and leads)
- Payments (customer transaction history, invoice templates and contracts)
- Sites (includes websites, funnels, and form templates)
- Marketing (includes email templates)
- Memberships (community platform for customers)
- Media Storage (includes client PDFs, website images, event documents, audio recordings)
- Settings (domain settings, encryption and security)

The file below contains a sample structured inventory of all business-critical assets inside the GoHighLevel platform to support visibility, risk reduction, and secure configuration practices. To protect the privacy of the business, and to simplify the inventory for demonstration purposes, I have anonymized and condensed many of the items.
