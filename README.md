# CIS Controls Version 8.1 Implementation Project for a SaaS Based Online Business
This is a project walkthrough of a complete CIS Controls implementation that I designed for a real small-sized business (business name redacted for privacy) built on the GoHighLevel Platform (Elite360). 

In this project, I performed an audit of an online coaching business utilizing the CIS Controls Version 8.1 framework. Once I completed the audit, I then provided steps for remediation in order tp make this business compliant based on these controls.

**Note:** Due to the fact that this business built all of their digital assets on a SaaS platform, not all CIS controls will be applicable for this project since I do not have access to the GoHighLevel/Elite360 IT infrastructure. Therefore, the CIS Controls Framework has been adapted for SaaS usage instead of infrastructure hardening.

This project contains anonymized configurations and data for demonstration purposes only. No real customer, business, or platform credentials are included in this repository.
